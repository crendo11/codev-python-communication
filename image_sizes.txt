Warning: This system is not isoplanatic at field(s)  2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
               Any PSF results are of questionable value for assessing
               the image quality, except in those cases where the user is
               interested only in the image of a point-like object.  The

Warning: This system is not isoplanatic at field(s)  2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
               Any PSF results are of questionable value for assessing
               the image quality, except in those cases where the user is
               interested only in the image of a point-like object.  The
